# 0x00. C - Hello, World #

This is the beginning of C-Programing on C using Vi and Emacs. I have installed the gcc compiler using codeblocks

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **Preprocessor**
  * [0-preprocessor](./0-preprocessor): Bash name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`, the output should be saved in the file `c`
  
* **Compiler**
    * [1-compiler](./1-compiler): The `C` file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`. The output file should be named the same as the `C` file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c.`
       * Example: if the `C` file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.o`

* **Assembler**
  * [2-assembler](./2-assembler): Bash script that generates the assembly code of a `C` code and save it in an output `$CFILE`; The output file should be named the same as the `C` file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`
       * Example: if the `C` file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.s`

* **Name**
  * [3-name](./3-name): Bash script that compiles a `C` file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
  
* **Hello puts**
  * [4-puts.c](./4-puts.c): `C` program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"`, followed by a new line `printf`.
  
  * **Hello, printf**   
    * [5-printf.c](./5-printf.c):  `C` program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art`, followed by a new line using the command `printf`
    
* **Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation**
  * [6-size.c](./6-size.c): `C` program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
  
* **Intel**
  * [100-intel](./100-intel): script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a `C` code and save it in an output file.
     * The `C` file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE` with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.
         * Example: if the C file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.s`.
