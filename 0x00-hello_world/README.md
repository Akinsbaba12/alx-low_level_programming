# 0x00. C - Hello, World #

This is the beginning of C-Programing on C using Vi and Emacs. I have installed the gcc compiler using codeblocks

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **Preprocessor**
  * [0-preprocessor](./0-preprocessor): Bash name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`, the output should be saved in the file `c`
  
* **Compiler**
    * [1-compiler](./1-compiler): The `C` file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`. The output file should be named the same as the `C` file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c.`
       * Example: if the `C` file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.o`

* **Assembler**
  * [2-assembler](./2-assembler): Bash script that generates the assembly code of a `C` code and save it in an output `$CFILE`; The output file should be named the same as the `C` file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`
       * Example: if the `C` file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.s`
