## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0-preprocessor**
  * [0-preprocessor](./0-preprocessor): Bash name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`, the output should be saved in the file `c`
  
  * **1-compiler**
    * [1-compiler](./1-compiler): The `C` file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`. The output file should be named the same as the `C` file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c.`
       * Example: if the `C` file is `main.c`, the output file should be `main.o`

* **2-assembler**
