# C - File I/O

refers to the ability of a program to read from or write to files on a computer's hard disk or other storage devices. C provides a set of functions that allow one to open files, read data from them, write data to them, close them, and perform other operations on them.

The basic steps involved in file handling include;

opening a file using the fopen() function.
Reading from or writing to the file using functions like fscanf(), fgets(), fputs(), fwrite() etc.
Closing the file using the fclose() function.
